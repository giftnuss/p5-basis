=head1 NAME

basis - use base with import call

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage is similar to L<base> or L<parent>:
    
    package Baz;
    use basis qw/Foo bar/;

Or with arguments for import:

    package Foo;
    use basis Bary => [go => "away"];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It uses Sub::Uplevel to do the construct

  BEGIN {
	  use base qw/Foo bal/;
	  Foo->import;
	  bal->import('tor');
  };

transparently for the parent and child class.

If the classname is followed by a array reference, than
the dereferenced array is used in the import call as argument.

Now it uses the C<import> method from the class named in the
global variable C<$basis::base>. When not set from outside, this
variable will be set during the first load of this module. It
defaults to C<parent> and as second alternative to C<base>.

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTE

The call of Sub::Uplevel might come to late, so the uplevel call 
will not work as expected. If you use this module, the same rule 
as for Sub::Uplevel applies:

Use Sub::Uplevel as early as possible in your program.

Now this modul croaks when Sub::Uplevel is not used earlier enough.
